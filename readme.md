# Rusty Editor

A video editor that focuses on options, with the goal of letting you do pretty much anything. Instead of breakpoints, all 'numbers' are so-called Curves. For example, instead of using breakpoints to smoothly zoom out from 1.0x to 0.5x like you usually do, this editor lets you set zoom to a linear function from 1.0 to 0.5. This way of doing things also allows you to, for example set zoom to (1-sin(t*Pi)) instead, which will make your image become small and then big again, following an upside-down sin curve.

# Is this useful?

Probably not, but I felt limited by some of the video editors I have used in the past and thought this would be an interesting project no matter the outcome. And since quite a bit of effort has gone into this now, I felt i should also put it on my github.
