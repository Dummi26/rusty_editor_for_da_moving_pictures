!?  - Priority | Needs thought | Effort (0-9+X)
  8 - Add effect that makes pixels transparent based on their color (greenscreen/key)
! 4 - Sort files in ./src/ (especially video caching, rendering, and data structs)
! 5 - Use Speedy2D for GPU accelerated drawing/rendering (!) and UI
 ?4 - Make effect parsing more modular (and not hardcoded in the parser)
 ?7 - Add Bezier to Curve
!?3 - How do we handle t=1.0? It shouldn't exist but then what is the "last" frame? Depends on export framerate? Is that fine or is that so bad that it needs a fix or an extra condition (i.e. length is exclusive UNLESS it reaches all the way to 1.0 or something)
  2 - Move transparency_adjustments out of video and into an effect.
 ?3 - Is it useful to make the timing in Curve::Chain a Curve of itself (rather than a static f64), or does that cause more confusion than anything? Might change to using curves there when I have a decent gui.
! 4 - [assets manager] For content::image::Image, when loading any image from disk, first check if it is already present and loaded to avoid unnecessary disk strain.
  7 - Top content in vertical Half split has some issues with mouse position.
  6 - When placing a dragged window on a placeholder by clicking (not just releasing), the placeholder might add a "replace me with x" request, which will consume the dragged window. Temp user fix: Click on one entry in the placeholder, move the mouse to another before releasing.
! 4 - Video Previews CAN BE CONSUMED, BUT CAN'T BE READDED!
